// Common base styles
// Only includes custom styles that aren't covered by Bootstrap

// Remove focus outline for mouse users, keep for keyboard
:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}

// Section spacing (custom to the project)
.section {
  padding: $section-padding-y $section-padding-x;
}

/*
  Note: Many common styles have been removed as they're already provided by Bootstrap:
  - Box-sizing reset
  - Body background and text adjustments
  - Image max-width behavior
  - Form element basic styling
  - Container styling
  - Table styling
  
  For these elements, rely on Bootstrap's default styling.
