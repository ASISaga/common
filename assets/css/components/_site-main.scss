// SCSS for the main content area of the site
// Merged .site-content styles into .site-main for semantic structure

.site-main {
  // Place any previous .site-content styles here, or extend Bootstrap utilities as needed
  @extend .container-fluid;
  // Add more layout or spacing utilities as required
}

// If there were any .site-content specific styles, merge them here as nested selectors
// Example:
// .site-main {
//   // former .site-content styles
// }
